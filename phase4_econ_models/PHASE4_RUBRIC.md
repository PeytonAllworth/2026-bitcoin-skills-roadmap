## 🎯 Phase 4 (Lite) Minimum Viable Skills

**Before moving to Phase 5, you MUST be able to:**

1. ✅ **Understand basic Bitcoin economics** (mining, fees, incentives)
2. ✅ **Use existing economic models and calculators**
3. ✅ **Run scenario analysis** (what if X changes?)
4. ✅ **Make charts showing economic scenarios**
5. ✅ **Interpret results correctly**
6. ✅ **Write economic analysis for policy audiences**

**Note:** You do NOT need to build models from scratch (that's the "Lite" approach)

**If you can do all 6 → You're ready for Phase 5!**

## 💡 Testing Your Knowledge

**The "Scenario Test":**

Can you answer these without extensive research?

1. **If Bitcoin price doubles, what happens to:**
   - Miner profitability?
   - Mining difficulty?
   - Fee pressure?

2. **If block subsidy halves (2028), what happens to:**
   - Miner revenue?
   - Security budget?
   - Need for higher fees?

3. **If transaction fees increase 5x, what happens to:**
   - Lightning Network adoption?
   - On-chain activity?
   - User behavior?

**If you can reason through these → You understand Bitcoin economics!**

## 🚨 Red Flags (Need More Work)

**If you see these, you're NOT ready for Phase 5:**

- ❌ You can't explain mining economics
- ❌ You don't understand fee markets
- ❌ You can't run simple scenarios
- ❌ You confuse correlation and causation
- ❌ Your analysis is always wrong
- ❌ You can't connect economics to policy

**Solution:** Watch more MRU videos, read more Bitcoin economic analysis, practice scenarios.

---

## ✨ Signs You're Crushing Phase 4

**You're ready to move on if:**

- ✅ You think in economic terms naturally
- ✅ You can analyze Bitcoin economic questions quickly
- ✅ Your scenario analysis is insightful
- ✅ You connect economics to policy easily
- ✅ You're ready to test economic theories with data (Phase 5!)

**Congratulations! Move to Phase 5!** 🎉

---

**Remember:** Phase 4 Lite is about USING and UNDERSTANDING economics, not building PhD-level models.

If you can analyze Bitcoin economic scenarios and explain them clearly → **You passed Phase 4 Lite.**

**Optional:** If you loved Phase 4 and want to go deeper, complete the Production Function Module!
