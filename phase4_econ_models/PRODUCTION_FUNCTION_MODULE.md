## 📺 Video Assignments (Watch in Order)

### Week 1: Production Function Basics

**Assignment 1: Introduction to Production Functions**
- 📺 **[MRU: Introduction to the Production Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxQmb04navk)** (7 minutes)
- 📺 **[MRU: Diminishing Marginal Product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKQ7Ka7MXbU)** (5 minutes)

**What to focus on:**
- What is a production function? (Output as a function of inputs)
- Marginal product (how output changes when you add one more unit of input)
- Diminishing returns (why the 10th worker adds less than the 1st)

**Take notes on:**
- How does Bitcoin mining fit this framework?
- What are the "inputs" to Bitcoin mining?
- What is the "output"?

### Week 2: Cobb-Douglas Production Function

**Assignment 2: Cobb-Douglas Basics**
- 📺 **[YouTube: Cobb-Douglas Production Function Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV6h5P1p_uI)** (~12 minutes)
  - Search this title if link breaks: "Cobb Douglas Production Function"
- 📺 **[Khan Academy: Marginal Product of Labor](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/production-cost-and-the-perfect-competition-model-temporary/short-run-production-costs/v/marginal-product-of-labor-apf)** (8 minutes)

**What to focus on:**
- The Cobb-Douglas formula: Y = A * L^α * K^β
  - Y = output
  - L = labor input
  - K = capital input
  - A = technology/efficiency parameter
  - α, β = elasticities (how responsive output is to each input)
- What "returns to scale" means
- How to interpret the exponents (α and β)

**Take notes on:**
- How could this apply to Bitcoin mining?
  - Y = hashrate produced?
  - L = labor (miners, operators)?
  - K = capital (ASIC machines)?
  - A = mining efficiency/technology?

### Week 3: Returns to Scale

**Assignment 3: Understanding Returns to Scale**
- 📺 **[MRU: Returns to Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EEj5VHSFdw)** (6 minutes)
- 📺 **[YouTube: Returns to Scale Explained with Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOuZJLlL4gQ)** (~10 minutes)
  - Search: "returns to scale economics" if link breaks

**What to focus on:**
- Constant returns to scale (double inputs → double output)
- Increasing returns to scale (double inputs → more than double output)
- Decreasing returns to scale (double inputs → less than double output)
- In Cobb-Douglas: if α + β = 1, you have constant returns

**Think about:**
- Does Bitcoin mining have increasing or decreasing returns to scale?
- What happens when mining pools get bigger?
- Are there network effects or economies of scale?

## ✍️ Written Essay Assignment

### **Essay Topic: "Applying Production Function Analysis to Bitcoin Mining"**

**Length:** 1,500-2,000 words (~3-5 pages, double-spaced)

**Deadline:** Complete before starting Phase 4 projects

---

### Essay Prompt:

**Using production function theory (specifically Cobb-Douglas if applicable), analyze Bitcoin mining as an economic production process.**

Your essay should address:

1. **Define the Production Function for Bitcoin Mining**
   - What is being "produced"? (hashrate? blocks? BTC revenue?)
   - What are the key inputs? (capital, labor, energy, technology)
   - Can you express Bitcoin mining as a Cobb-Douglas function? Why or why not?

2. **Analyze Returns to Scale in Bitcoin Mining**
   - Do larger mining operations have advantages? (economies of scale?)
   - What does the data suggest about returns to scale?
   - How does mining pool concentration relate to returns to scale?

3. **Consider Marginal Products**
   - What is the marginal product of adding one more ASIC miner?
   - How does the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment affect marginal product?
   - Does Bitcoin mining exhibit diminishing marginal returns? Why?

4. **Technology Parameter (Total Factor Productivity)**
   - How has mining technology (ASIC efficiency) changed over time?
   - How would you capture this in the production function?
   - What happens to the production function when a new generation of ASICs is released?

5. **Policy Implications**
   - What does production function analysis tell us about Bitcoin mining centralization?
   - Are there natural limits to mining concentration based on production economics?
   - How might policy (energy regulations, tariffs on mining equipment) affect the production function?

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before You Write:
1. **Watch all videos** and take detailed notes
2. **Research Bitcoin mining** data (hash price, pool concentration, ASIC specs)
3. **Outline your essay** - know your argument before writing
4. **Find 2-3 examples** from real Bitcoin mining to illustrate points

### While Writing:
1. **Use specific numbers** where possible (e.g., "Bitmain's S19 produces 110 TH/s")
2. **Draw simple graphs** if helpful (input vs output)
3. **Acknowledge limitations** - Bitcoin doesn't fit production functions perfectly, that's OK
4. **Connect to policy** - this is ultimately for policy work

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- ❌ Being too abstract - use concrete Bitcoin examples
- ❌ Forcing the framework - if it doesn't fit perfectly, explain why
- ❌ Ignoring the difficulty adjustment - it's crucial!
- ❌ Forgetting energy as an input - electricity is a major input
- ❌ Writing like an academic paper - write clearly, like your Phase 1 memos

## 📊 Optional: Include Simple Analysis

If you want to go deeper, you can include:

**Simple Production Function Model:**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple Cobb-Douglas for Bitcoin Mining
# Hashrate = A * Capital^α * Energy^β

A = 100  # Technology parameter (arbitrary units)
alpha = 0.6  # Capital elasticity
beta = 0.4  # Energy elasticity

capital = np.linspace(1, 100, 100)  # Capital (number of ASICs)
energy = 50  # Fixed energy input

hashrate = A * (capital ** alpha) * (energy ** beta)

plt.plot(capital, hashrate)
plt.xlabel('Capital (Number of ASICs)')
plt.ylabel('Hashrate Produced (TH/s)')
plt.title('Bitcoin Mining Production Function')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Include this chart in your essay** with interpretation!

## 🎯 What Success Looks Like

After completing this module and writing the essay, you should be able to:

✅ **Explain production functions** to a policy staffer in 2 minutes  
✅ **Apply economic theory** to Bitcoin mining questions  
✅ **Analyze centralization concerns** using economic frameworks  
✅ **Write about complex econ topics** clearly and accessibly  
✅ **Connect theory to policy** implications  

This is the bridge between Phase 1 (policy writing) and Phase 4 (economic analysis).

## 📤 Submitting Your Essay

**For self-study:** Save your essay in `/phase4_econ_models/projects/`

**File name:** `bitcoin_mining_production_function_essay.md` or `.pdf`

**Self-evaluation:** After writing, wait 2-3 days, then re-read and grade yourself using the criteria above.

**Optional:** Share with a BPI colleague or economist friend for feedback

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Lighter Version

**If full essay feels like too much:**

Write a **shorter policy memo** (2-3 pages) titled:
"Economic Analysis: Why Bitcoin Mining Exhibits Decreasing Returns to Scale at the Pool Level"

- Same concepts, policy-memo format
- Focus on one aspect (returns to scale)
- Include one simple chart
- Write for a staffer, not an academic

This still builds the skills but is more aligned with your Phase 1 training.

**This module is OPTIONAL.** The Phase 4 Lite approach doesn't require this depth. But if you want to truly understand production functions and connect them to Bitcoin, this is how you do it.
