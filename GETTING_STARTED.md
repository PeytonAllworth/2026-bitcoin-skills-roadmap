# 🚀 Getting Started - Day 1 Guide

**Welcome to your 2026 Bitcoin Skills Roadmap!**

This guide tells you exactly what to do on Day 1 and how to start building your skills.

---

## 📅 When to Start

**Ideal start date:** Early January 2026 (beginning of BPI fellowship)  
**Can start earlier:** November-December 2025 with Phase 1 prep

---

## ✅ Day 1 Checklist

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment (1 hour)

**Install Python & Jupyter:**

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.10 or newer
   - Install (check "Add Python to PATH" on Windows)

2. **Install Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Should open in your browser
   - If it works, you're good!

4. **Install a code editor (optional but recommended):**
   - VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Install Python extension in VS Code

**Alternative (easier):**
- Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
- Comes with everything pre-installed
- Recommended if you're new to Python

---

### Step 2: Read the Overview (30 minutes)

**Read these files in order:**
1. Main `README.md` (overview of all phases)
2. `2026_LITE_APPROACH.md` (understand the strategy)
3. `LEARNING_RESOURCES.md` (bookmark for later)

**Understand:**
- ✅ The phases and what they cover
- ✅ Why "Lite" approach is smart for busy schedules
- ✅ The capstone project at the end
- ✅ Time commitment (~12 hrs/week average)

---

### Step 3: Phase 1 Setup (30 minutes)

**Navigate to:** `/phase1_policy_memos/`

**Read:**
1. `PHASE1_GUIDE.md` - Full guide for Phase 1
2. Skim `clarity_act_briefing_memo.md` - Example of what you'll write

**Understand:**
- ✅ Phase 1 is pure policy writing (no coding!)
- ✅ You'll learn Python in parallel (separate track)
- ✅ First goal: Write Senate-ready memos

---

### Step 4: Start Learning (Week 1)

**Two parallel tracks start now:**

#### **Track A: Policy Writing (5-6 hrs/week)**

**Week 1 tasks:**
1. Read 3-5 example policy memos:
   - Coin Center: https://www.coincenter.org/education/
   - Cato Institute: https://www.cato.org/
   - Brookings: https://www.brookings.edu/

2. Read about The Clarity Act:
   - Search Congress.gov for latest version
   - Read summaries from Coin Center/Cato

3. Outline your first memo:
   - Topic: What the Clarity Act does (1-2 pages)
   - Don't write yet, just outline
   - See `memo_templates/` folder for structure ideas

**Time: ~5-6 hours total**

#### **Track B: Python Basics (3-5 hrs/week)**

**Week 1 tasks:**
1. Start Kaggle Python course:
   - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
   - Do lessons 1-3 (variables, functions, booleans)
   - Interactive, free, ~2-3 hours

2. Install Python (if not done already)

3. Run your first Python code:
   ```python
   print("Hello Bitcoin Policy!")
   ```

**Time: ~3-4 hours total**

---

✅ **Written your first line of Python code**  

**Total time Week 1: ~8-10 hours**

---

## 🗓️ Week 2-4 Plan

## 📁 Folder Organization

**How to organize your work:**

```
2026-bitcoin-skills-roadmap/
├── phase1_policy_memos/
│   ├── drafts/
│   │   └── clarity_act_v1.md  ← Your work goes here
│   ├── projects/
│   │   └── final_policy_brief.md  ← Final project
│   └── memo_templates/
```

**Tips:**
- Keep drafts in `drafts/` folder
- Move final work to `projects/` folder
- Date your files: `clarity_act_2026-01-15.md`
- Back up your work (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

---

## 💡 Motivation Tips

**For when it gets hard:**

1. **Remember why:** $80k → $135k+ in 2028 (if you finish)
2. **Small wins count:** Did 1 hour today? That's progress.
3. **Compare to peers:** Most people will just talk about Bitcoin. You're actually learning it.
4. **The capstone:** By Dec 2026, you'll have a research paper that opens doors.
5. **It's okay to adjust:** Phases can take longer. Life happens. The roadmap is a guide, not a prison.

**You've got this!** 🚀

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Week 1 pitfalls:**

1. ❌ **Trying to do too much** - Don't start Phase 2 yet!
2. ❌ **Perfectionism** - Your first memo will be rough. That's OK.
3. ❌ **Skipping Python** - You'll regret it in Phase 2.
4. ❌ **Not taking breaks** - 10 hrs/week is plenty. Don't burn out.
5. ❌ **Comparing to experts** - You're a beginner. Experts had 10,000+ hours.

**Remember:** Progress over perfection.
