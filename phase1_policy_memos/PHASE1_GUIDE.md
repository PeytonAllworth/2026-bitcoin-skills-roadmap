# Phase 1 Guide - Policy Skills & Communication

## What This Phase Is About

Learning to write **Senate-ready briefing memos** that translate complex Bitcoin topics into clear, neutral policy language.

This is your most important starting phase — it determines how fast you become useful in D.C.

## 🐍 Parallel Track: Prepare for Phase 2 (Python Basics)

**While you're doing Phase 1 policy writing, use extra time to learn Python basics so you're ready for Phase 2.**

### Why Learn Python Now?
Phase 2 (Data Visualization) starts right after Phase 1 and requires Python. Learning it now means no delay when you're ready for charts.

### Time Commitment:
- **Phase 1 work:** 5-8 hours/week (policy writing)
- **Python learning:** 3-5 hours/week (separate track)
- **Total:** 8-13 hours/week

### 🎯 Python Learning Goals for Phase 2 Readiness

By the end of Phase 1, you should be able to:

✅ **Basic Python:**
- Write variables, lists, dictionaries
- Use for loops and if statements
- Define simple functions
- Import and use libraries

✅ **Pandas Basics:**
- Load CSV files into DataFrames
- Filter and select data
- Basic data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Group and aggregate data

✅ **Basic Visualization:**
- Create simple matplotlib plots
- Understand how to make line charts and scatter plots
- (You'll learn the rest in Phase 2)

### 🗓️ Suggested Schedule (Jan-Mar 2026)

**Week 1-2:**
- Phase 1: Start reading policy examples, outline first memo
- Python: Complete basic Python tutorial (variables, loops, functions)

**Week 3-6:**
- Phase 1: Write Clarity Act briefing memo drafts
- Python: Learn pandas (DataFrames, filtering, grouping)

**Week 7-10:**
- Phase 1: Complete policy brief, get feedback, revise
- Python: Basic matplotlib (line charts, scatter plots)

**Week 11-12:**
- Phase 1: Final personal project (policy brief on chosen topic)
- Python: Practice problems, solidify knowledge

**By end of Phase 1:** You can write Senate-ready memos AND you're ready to make Bitcoin charts!

---

### ✅ How to Know You're Ready for Phase 2

Test yourself:
1. Can you load a CSV file and print the first 10 rows?
2. Can you filter data (e.g., "show me only rows where price > 100")?
3. Can you make a simple line chart?

If yes to all three → You're ready for Phase 2!

### 💡 Learning Tips

- **Code along with tutorials** - Don't just watch, type the code
- **Use Jupyter notebooks** - Same environment you'll use in Phase 2
- **Practice daily** - 20 min/day > 2 hours on Sunday
- **Don't aim for perfection** - Just get comfortable enough to start Phase 2
- **Google is your friend** - "How to filter pandas dataframe" will be searched 1000 times

## Key Skills
- Structuring briefing memos (1-2 pages)
- Clear, concise policy writing
- Translating technical concepts for non-technical readers
- Understanding staffer needs

## Workflow
1. **Read examples:** Look at Cato, Coin Center, and Brookings memos
2. **Study the topic:** Understand The Clarity Act (or another policy issue)
3. **Outline first:** Before writing, create a clear structure
4. **Write rough draft:** Get your ideas down
5. **Edit ruthlessly:** Can you cut it in half and keep the key points?
6. **Test for clarity:** Would a busy staffer understand this in 3 minutes?

## What Makes a Good Policy Memo
- **Lead with the bottom line:** What's the key takeaway?
- **Use headers:** Make it scannable
- **Avoid jargon:** If you must use a technical term, define it
- **Be neutral:** Present facts and implications, not opinions
- **Be brief:** 1-2 pages for briefings, 3-5 for deep dives
- **Action-oriented:** What should the reader know or do?

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Personal Project (Required)

**Once you've completed your practice memos and reading, write ONE original policy brief on a current Bitcoin policy issue.**

### Link to Your Completed Project:
`[Project title here - add when done]` → `[Link or file path]`

### Project Ideas (pick one or create your own):
1. **CBDC vs Bitcoin Policy Brief** - Compare policy implications of a U.S. CBDC versus Bitcoin adoption (privacy, freedom, innovation)
2. **Bitcoin Mining & Energy Policy** - Write a balanced memo on Bitcoin mining's energy use, grid benefits, and policy considerations
3. **Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Analysis** - Analyze Senator Lummis's Bitcoin reserve proposal: mechanics, benefits, risks, and implementation considerations

**Better yet:** After completing the exercises, choose a current policy debate you're following and write a brief that would help staffers understand the issue.

### Deliverable:
- 3-5 page policy brief
- Clear structure with executive summary
- Non-technical language
- Balanced analysis
- Policy recommendations or considerations

### Why This Matters:
This is your most important skill. If you can write clear, useful memos, you become indispensable. If you can't, nothing else matters.

## 📁 Note on Repository Structure

**For now:** Your personal project can live in this phase folder (`/phase1_policy_memos/projects/` or similar).

**Later (optional):** If you want to share your work professionally, you can move it to a separate repository (e.g., `bitcoin-policy-briefs`) and link it in the main README. This makes it easier to share with staffers and looks more professional on GitHub.

**Reminder to Cursor AI:** This phase can eventually become its own repository if the user chooses to split their work for portfolio purposes. Support either approach based on what the user asks for.
