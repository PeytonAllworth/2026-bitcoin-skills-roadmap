## 💡 Tips for Self-Evaluation

1. **Wait 24 hours before evaluating** - Fresh eyes see more
2. **Read your memo out loud** - Catches awkward phrasing
3. **Pretend you're a busy staffer** - Would you read this?
4. **Compare to professional examples** - How does yours stack up?
5. **Get external feedback** - BPI colleagues, friends, AI tools
6. **Be honest but not harsh** - You're learning!

## 🚨 Red Flags (Need More Work)

**If you see these, you're NOT ready for Phase 2:**

- ❌ Your memos are consistently >3 pages for simple topics
- ❌ Technical people say you got Bitcoin facts wrong
- ❌ Readers ask "what does this mean?" multiple times
- ❌ You can't write a memo without extensive research each time
- ❌ Your memos take 5+ hours to write
- ❌ You're uncomfortable with the policy writing format

**Solution:** Do 2-3 more practice memos before moving on.

## ✨ Signs You're Crushing Phase 1

**You're ready to move on if:**

- ✅ Colleagues ask YOU to review their memos
- ✅ You write memos confidently and quickly
- ✅ Your explanations are clearer than the sources you read
- ✅ You enjoy policy writing (or at least don't dread it)
- ✅ You're already thinking about Phase 2 projects

**Congratulations! Move to Phase 2 with confidence!** 🎉

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfection. The goal is **good enough to be useful on the Hill.**

If a chief of staff would read your memo and understand the issue → **You passed Phase 1.**
