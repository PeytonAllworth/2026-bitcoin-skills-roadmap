## 💡 Testing Your Knowledge

**The "Explain to a Friend" Test:**

Call a friend (or imagine explaining to a staffer) and explain:

1. **What is the Lightning Network?** (30 seconds)
2. **How does it work?** (2 minutes)
3. **Why does Bitcoin need it?** (1 minute)
4. **Is it safe/centralized?** (1 minute)

**If you can do this clearly without notes → You understand Lightning!**

## 🚨 Red Flags (Need More Work)

**If you see these, you're NOT ready for Phase 4:**

- ❌ You can't explain Lightning without reading notes
- ❌ You're confused about channels vs transactions
- ❌ You don't understand liquidity issues
- ❌ You can't find LN data sources
- ❌ You haven't completed any analysis notebooks
- ❌ You can't connect LN to policy discussions

**Solution:** Re-read Mastering the Lightning Network, watch more videos, do more analysis.

---

## ✨ Signs You're Crushing Phase 3

**You're ready to move on if:**

- ✅ You can explain Lightning clearly and confidently
- ✅ You correct others' misconceptions about Lightning
- ✅ You've analyzed real network data
- ✅ You can discuss LN pros/cons intelligently
- ✅ You're excited to apply economic analysis to LN (Phase 4!)

**Congratulations! Move to Phase 4!** 🎉

**Remember:** Lightning is complex. If you can explain it to a non-technical person and they "get it" → **You passed Phase 3.**

The goal isn't to become a Lightning node operator. The goal is to **understand Lightning well enough to write about it for policy audiences.**
