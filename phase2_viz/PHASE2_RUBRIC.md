1. ✅ **Load Bitcoin data (CSV or API) into pandas**
2. ✅ **Create clean line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots**
3. ✅ **Add proper labels, titles, and legends**
4. ✅ **Apply smoothing to noisy data**
5. ✅ **Use log scales when appropriate**
6. ✅ **Export publication-quality charts**
7. ✅ **Write clean, commented Python code**

**If you can do all 7 → You're ready for Phase 3!**

## 💡 Self-Evaluation Tips

1. **Show charts to non-technical people** - Can they understand it?
2. **Compare to professional examples** - Check Bloomberg, FT, WSJ charts
3. **Print your charts** - Do they look good on paper?
4. **Wait 24 hours** - Does the chart still make sense?
5. **Check for honesty** - Are scales appropriate? Any misleading elements?

## 🚨 Red Flags (Need More Work)

**If you see these, you're NOT ready for Phase 3:**

- ❌ Charts consistently take 2+ hours to make
- ❌ Code is messy and you can't find your own variables
- ❌ Charts are unclear or confusing
- ❌ You can't explain what the chart shows
- ❌ You struggle with basic pandas operations
- ❌ You copy/paste code without understanding it

**Solution:** Do 3-5 more practice charts before moving on.

## ✨ Signs You're Crushing Phase 2

**You're ready to move on if:**

- ✅ You make charts quickly and confidently
- ✅ Colleagues compliment your visualizations
- ✅ You can debug your own Python errors
- ✅ You think in pandas (DataFrames are natural)
- ✅ You're excited to apply this to Lightning Network data

**Congratulations! Move to Phase 3!** 🎉

**Remember:** Your charts should make staffers say "Oh, I get it!" not "Huh?"

If a busy policymaker glances at your chart and understands the trend → **You passed Phase 2.**
