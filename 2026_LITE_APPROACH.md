# 2026 Lite Approach - Smart Path for Busy Hill Staffers

## The Strategy: Breadth in 2026, Depth in 2027

You're working 55 hours/week. You're early in your career. You need **practical skills fast**, not academic perfection.

This roadmap is now optimized for **applied learning** - you'll learn to USE tools and UNDERSTAND concepts, not build everything from scratch.

## 📊 2026 Lite vs 2027 Deep Dive

| Phase | 2026 Lite (Applied Skills) | 2027 Deep Dive (Optional) |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Write Senate-ready memos | ✅ Already complete |
| **Phase 2** | Make clean Bitcoin charts | Add advanced viz (plotly, dashboards) |
| **Phase 3** | Understand & explain Lightning | Run your own Lightning node |
| **Phase 4** | Use & understand economic models | Build models from scratch |
| **Phase 5** | Run regressions & interpret | Build automated data pipelines |

---

## 🎯 What You'll Be Able To Do (End of 2026)

After completing the Lite versions, you can:

### Policy (Phase 1)
✅ Write 1-2 page briefing memos  
✅ Translate complex Bitcoin topics into clear language  
✅ Produce talking points and policy briefs  

### Data Visualization (Phase 2)
✅ Make publication-quality Bitcoin/Lightning charts  
✅ Smooth noisy data and use log scales  
✅ Create charts that staffers understand instantly  

### Lightning Network (Phase 3)
✅ Explain Lightning Network clearly to non-technical people  
✅ Analyze channel data and liquidity patterns  
✅ Understand routing and node economics  

### Economic Analysis (Phase 4 Lite)
✅ **Understand** economic models (not build from scratch)  
✅ Run scenario analysis (what if BTC price doubles?)  
✅ Use existing tools and calculators  
✅ Write data-driven economic analysis  
✅ Apply economic reasoning to Bitcoin policy questions  

**What you're skipping:** Deriving production functions, complex calibration, building models from first principles

### Data Analysis (Phase 5 Lite)
✅ **Run regressions** with statsmodels  
✅ Interpret p-values, R², coefficients correctly  
✅ Make regression charts with confidence intervals  
✅ Load and clean data (basics)  
✅ Write data-driven policy analysis  

**What you're skipping:** Building automated ETL pipelines, SQLite databases, async API systems, production code

## 💪 Why This Makes You Valuable

**In 2026, you'll be able to:**
- Write clear policy memos (rare skill)
- Make honest, beautiful charts (most staffers can't)
- Explain Lightning Network (almost nobody on the Hill can)
- Run statistical analysis and interpret results (very rare)
- Apply economic reasoning to Bitcoin questions (extremely rare)

**This alone puts you in the top 1% of Hill staffers for Bitcoin policy work.**

## 🚀 If You Want More in 2027

After a year of using these skills, IF you want to go deeper:

### Phase 4 Advanced (2027)
- Learn calculus derivatives (2-3 weeks)
- Study production functions deeply (see `PRODUCTION_FUNCTION_MODULE.md` in phase4_econ_models)
- Build economic models from scratch
- Write academic-quality papers

**Optional now:** The Production Function Module includes video assignments and an essay connecting Cobb-Douglas to Bitcoin mining. Available if you want to go deeper during Phase 4.

### Phase 5 Advanced (2027)
- Build automated data pipelines
- Learn SQLite and database design
- Create production-quality code
- Advanced statistical methods

**But honestly?** The Lite versions might be all you need for Hill work. The advanced versions are for if you want to transition to research/academia later.

## ⏰ Realistic Time Commitments (2026 Lite)

| Phase | Weekly Hours | Total Weeks | Total Hours |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 + Python | 8-10 hrs | 12 weeks | ~100 hrs |
| Phase 2 | 6-8 hrs | 16 weeks | ~110 hrs |
| Phase 3 | 8-10 hrs | 20 weeks | ~180 hrs |
| Phase 4 Lite | 6-8 hrs | 16 weeks | ~110 hrs |
| Phase 5 Lite | 6-8 hrs | 16 weeks | ~110 hrs |

**Total for all 5 phases: ~610 hours over 12 months**

That's **12 hours/week average** - totally doable with a 55-hour work week.

Compare to the original "build everything from scratch" approach: **~900+ hours**

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy (2026)

### Use AI as a Teaching Assistant, Not a Crutch

**Good use of Cursor/AI:**
- "I wrote this regression code, can you check if my interpretation is correct?"
- "Here's my economic analysis, did I miss any key factors?"
- "I'm getting an error in this pandas code, what's wrong?"

**Bad use of Cursor/AI:**
- "Write a regression analysis for me" (you learn nothing)
- "Explain this entire topic to me" (just do the reading)
- "Build this model for me" (defeats the purpose)

### The 80/20 Rule

- You'll get 80% of the career value from 20% of the technical depth
- Master the INTERPRETATION and APPLICATION
- Leave the ENGINEERING and THEORY for later (if needed)

### Build Skills, Don't Collect Certifications

Your goal isn't to say "I can build production data pipelines."  
Your goal is to say "I can answer policy questions with data."

## ✅ Success Metrics (End of 2026)

You've succeeded if you can:

1. ✅ **Write a memo** a chief of staff can use immediately
2. ✅ **Make a chart** that clearly shows a Bitcoin trend
3. ✅ **Explain Lightning** in a 5-minute conversation
4. ✅ **Run a regression** and say "here's what the data shows"
5. ✅ **Do economic analysis** using scenarios and reasoning

**If you can do all five, you're in the top 1% for Hill Bitcoin policy work.**

## 🗓️ Recommended 2026 Timeline

| Period | Focus | Intensity |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Jan-Mar** | Phase 1 + Python | Moderate (8-10 hrs/wk) |
| **Apr-Jun** | Phase 2 | Light (6-8 hrs/wk, Hill is busy) |
| **Jul-Aug** | Phase 3 | Heavy (10-12 hrs/wk, recess) |
| **Sep-Oct** | Phase 4 Lite | Light (6-8 hrs/wk, busy period) |
| **Nov-Dec** | Phase 5 Lite + **Capstone** | Heavy (12-15 hrs/wk, final push) |

**Capstone Project (Dec 2026):** Final research paper integrating all skills - analyzing Bitcoin fees, macro factors, and Lightning Network with real data.

**By December 2026:** You have all the skills listed above.

**In December 2026:** Complete the **Capstone Research Paper** that integrates all your skills (see `CAPSTONE_RESEARCH_PAPER.md`)

**In 2027:** Decide if you want to go deeper or focus on using what you learned.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

**You're early in your career.** The goal isn't to become a PhD economist or a senior software engineer in one year.

The goal is to become:
- A policy staffer who can write clearly
- Who understands Bitcoin/Lightning deeply enough
- Who can make charts and run basic analysis
- Who doesn't need to rely on others to interpret data

**The Lite approach gets you there.**

The "build everything from scratch" approach would burn you out and probably fail.

**Choose sustainability over perfection.**

**Remember:** This roadmap is a guide, not a mandate. Adjust as you go. Skip sections if needed. The only "must do" is Phase 1 (policy writing) - everything else is bonus.
